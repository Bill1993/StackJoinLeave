StackJoinLeave
==============

Stack Join\Leave messages in your server.
A server I play on was tierd of the constant join/leave messeges, so I threw this togeather super fast, and decided that other people might like to use it.
It is not officialy released anywhere, so if you want to use it, you will have to download the source and compile it yourself!!!
Or download it from my Jenkins CI http://ci.willhastings.net/job/StackJoinLeave/


Every 3 minutes if 1 player has joined it will say,
"In the past 3 min {player1} have joined the server!" or if they left
"In the past 3 min {player1} have left the server!"

if 2 players have joined it will say,
"In the past 3 min {player1}, and {Player2} have joined the server!" or if they left
"In the past 3 min {player1}, and {Player2} have left the server!"

if 3 or more players have joined it will say,
"In the past 3 min {player1}, {Player2}, and {number of others} have joined the server!" or if they left
"In the past 3 min {player1}, {Player2}, and {number of others} have left the server!"
